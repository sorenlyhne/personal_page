          <h1>My Road to Code</h1>
          <p>
          Recently I read <a href="https://hackernoon.com/an-open-letter-to-less-experienced-developers-c33c16ea5e88">an article by Paul Robinson</a> that contained these gilt-edged words:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>
          Few things you can choose to do in your life will allow you to have such an impact on the betterment of humanity, if you choose to better humanity with these skills.
          </p>
          <p>
          With the laptop or PC you likely already have at home and some knowledge, you can create experiences for an audience of billions at virtually no cost other than your time. Those experiences can educate, entertain or enhance. They can turn people into superhumans of virtual Worlds in a game or titans of industry inside a spreadsheet. You can build mental muscles that leverage our capability as a species.
          </p>
          <p>
          Writing code sits at a fascinating and beautiful intersection between the analytical world of Science and the expressive potential of the creative arts. It is professional, rewarding, and well-paid.
          </p>
          <br>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
          There you have it. That is why I want to learn to code at Founders & Coders Nazareth. But my realization of this has been a long time coming – my dreams have gradually been shaped in the form of life's realities. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The following is a backwards-chronological account of how coding appeared at my horizon –  through pursuing music, studying cognitive semiotics, freelancing as a communicator, establishing a non-profit, and starting a business.

                              The Patchwork Plan is not going too well. <a href="http://andretanker.org/" target="_blank">Andre Tanker</a> hasn't received enough funding, <a href="http://thoracrafts.com/" target="_blank">Thora Crafts</a> isn't profitable yet, and I feel overwhelmed by too many pots on the stove. I finally give in: I need focus, I need something steady. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              I return to 80000hours.org and read their <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/" target="_blank">criteria for a dream job</a> and their recommendation of <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering/#exploration-value" target="_blank">software engineering as a career path</a>. I try coding, and it seems to fit me really well. The scalability makes it a great toolset for social change. I enjoy the helpful and rational community, the overlap with <a href="http://kandidat.au.dk/en/cognitivesemiotics/" target="_blank">cognitive semiotics</a>, and the way it induces flow. Not least, I'm confident I can become good at this. My mind is analytical, calm, and stubborn. I'm addicted to learning. In everything I've done, I've gravitated towards understanding the underlying structure of things. And I'm a creator – I just love to transform knowledge into things that work. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              I research my options, and quickly find that the ethos, price and curriculum of Founders & Coders would be perfect for a broke (but not broken) social entrepreneur like me. How awesome wouldn't it be to help others while helping myself?

                            <p>
                              While <a href="http://andretanker.org/" target="_blank">Andre Tanker</a> is satisfying my desire to potentially make a meaningful contribution to the world, it's not paying any bills. So I decide to add another piece to The Patchwork Plan by trying my luck <a href="https://www.junglescout.com/how-to-sell-on-amazon-infographic/" target="_blank">launching a private label product via Amazon FBA</a>. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              I go through product research, negotiations with suppliers, product development, and lots of formal stuff before I am able to launch my business, <a href="www.thoracrafts.com" target="_blank">Thora Crafts, and my Grosgrain Ribbon product</a>. I learn a great deal about business in general and ecommerce in particular. Namely it becomes clear how big a role is played by software companies in this economy – apparently, if you want to be rich during a gold rush, you should sell shovels. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              If I only knew how to code! It would be like <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/seize-the-means-of-production" target="_blank">seizing the means of production</a>. I have so many ideas…

                            <p>
                              One day I come across an article by <a href="https://80000hours.org/" target="_blank">80.000hours.org</a>, called <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/dont-follow-your-passion/" target="_blank">Don't Follow Your Passion</a>. It dramatically changes my perspective on my career. I realize music is not enough – I need to expand The Patchwork Plan and dedicate part of my work life to what I think is of great value: knowledge, thinking skills, enlightenment. My new personal mission statement: working for art and enlightenment. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              Not long after, I stumple upon the website of <a href="http://www.frameworksinstitute.org/" target="_blank">FrameWorks Institute</a>, an American think tank that promotes social change through science communication. They use a <a href="http://www.frameworksinstitute.org/sfa-overview.html" target="_blank">research method </a>that relies heavily on the disciplines of <a href="http://kandidat.au.dk/en/cognitivesemiotics/" target="_blank">cognitive semiotics</a>, and enthusiastically I call up two of my CogSem friends and suggest that we start an equivalent Danish organization. They're as excited as I am, and after getting the support from FrameWorks Institute, we found <a href="andretanker.org" target="_blank">Andre Tanker</a> ("Other Thoughts").

                              The next three years contain many hard lessons in organization building, project management and fundraising.

                              I get my master's degree in cognitive semiotics, and then what? Above all, I want to work seriously on my craft as a songwriter, which doesn't seem to leave room for a full-time job. In stead, I prepare myself to patch together multiple income streams through freelancing, teaching, gigging, etc.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              My first freelance job – one that I still hold today – is as a social media editor and writer for a <a href="https://www.design-people.com/" target="_blank">experience design agency</a>. While it certainly has sharpened my storytelling skills and given me an insight into the design world and how the user experience is crucial for the success of tech products, I certainly don't see myself doing communication as a career. I don't feel comfortable competing mindlessly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy" target="_blank">the attention economy</a>.
                              </p>

                              I also do various other things, such as <a href="https://da-dk.facebook.com/ingolfsessions/" target="_blank">recording music</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dreadnoughtus_schrani" target="_blank">producing music for other artists</a>, intern as a songwriting teacher at a music school, and conduct workshops for the local songwriter's guild.

                              As a graduate student of <a href="http://kandidat.au.dk/en/cognitivesemiotics/" target="_blank">cognitive semiotics</a>, I try to combine my interest in artistic creation with the study of human cognition and meaning-making.

                              <p>
                              That means focusing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitivism_(aesthetics)" target="_blank">cognitive aesthetics</a>, especially regarding the mental and artistic interplay between words and music. As a songwriter I'm always trying to convert the theoretical findings into artistic practice. I start to view songs as little machines of meaning making. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              I come out, not only with an understanding of the human mind, but also with a deep appreciation of enlightenment and rationalism

                              I finish my bachelor's degree and decide to devote a couple of years to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skvulp/?rc=p" target="_blank">Skvulp</a>, the band I have now been the leader of for three years.

                              <p>
                              Being a band leader involves a host of creative, social, organizational and technical skills, and you learn as you go. We record <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6nERS7RRFzw1Mk0emJuDyP" target="_blank">our first full-length album</a>, and as our producer suddenly jumps ship, I take on the challenge of learning audio production. I also organize our first tour: two weeks of sailing around in <a href="https://da-dk.facebook.com/pg/skvulp/photos/?tab=album&album_id=433424788504" target="_blank">an old wooden ship</a>, playing in Danish and German harbours.

                              Ok, I guess it's the university then. Let's go with <a href="http://bachelor.au.dk/en/aestheticsandculture/" target="_blank">Aesthetics and Culture</a>; that seems at least

                              <p>
                              In the third year of my bachelor's degree I take a supplementary course in Cognitive Semiotics. And I learn that art and science are indeed compatible in fascinating ways. It's my first step into the noble world of science – the pursuit of "the constant underlying the fluctuation", as the Danish linguist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Hjelmslev" target="_blank">Louis Hjelmslev</a> said.

Through highschool I practise a lot on my instrument, but I soon realize that songwriting is what really tickles me. Oh, the wonder of putting words and music together! I have to learn to create these wonderful creatures, songs. How do they work?
